# Bits Orchestra

As mentioned, I used **ASP.NET MVC** for this project. The following features were implemented:  

1. **File Upload**  
   Uploading a file and inserting its data into the database (the first row is expected to be the header).  

2. **Data Editing in a Table**  
   - Ability to delete rows.  
   - Filtering, sorting, and paginating data.  
   - Implemented using **JavaScript** and **AJAX**, as specified in the requirements.  
   - It can also be implemented using **Angular**, based on my skills.  

3. **Validation and Error Display**  
   Ensuring proper validation and displaying errors when necessary.  

## Run Instructions

To run the application, you need to specify the connection string for **MS SQL Server** in the `appsettings.json` file.
